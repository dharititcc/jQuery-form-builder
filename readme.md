# Introduction

jQuery formBuilder is a 100% client-side plugin that gives users the power to create forms using an intuitive drag and drop interface. FormBuilder supports a number of form fields and some html tags.

formRender is the companion plugin to formBuilder that lets you render the results of the created form. A typical use case would have formBuilder in an admin area of a site or app and formRender on the front-end. For this reason formRender and formBuilder are 2 separate plugins but can be used together to create an edit toggle.
